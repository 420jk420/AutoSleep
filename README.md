# ðŸ’¤ Auto Sleep

A simple Python script to automatically put your PC to sleep after a period of inactivity. Designed for people whose computers refuse to sleep properly due to background processes or unknown quirks.

## âœ… Features
- Automatically sleeps your PC after a set idle time
- Lightweight and runs silently in the background
- Easy to customize (sleep timer, checks, notifications)

## ðŸ’¡ Why?
Some systems simply won't enter sleep mode on their own â€” Auto Sleep fixes that by enforcing sleep after you've been inactive for a while.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/420jk420/AutoSleep.git
cd auto-sleep

Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the script
python auto_sleep.py

Configuration (sleep.py)
IDLE_TIME_LIMIT = 5400 # Time limit for inactivity (in seconds)
NOTIFICATION_TIMEOUT = 60  # Time limit for user to respond to notification (in seconds)

# ðŸ’¤ Auto Sleep

A simple Python script to automatically put your PC to sleep after a period of inactivity. Designed for people whose computers refuse to sleep properly due to background processes or unknown quirks.

## âœ… Features
- Automatically sleeps your PC after a set idle time
- Lightweight and runs silently in the background
- Easy to customize (sleep timer, checks, notifications)
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)

## ðŸ’¡ Why?
Some systems simply won't enter sleep mode on their own â€” Auto Sleep fixes that by enforcing sleep after you've been inactive for a while.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/420jk420/auto-sleep.git
cd auto-sleep
